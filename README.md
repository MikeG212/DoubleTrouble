# DoubleTrouble
## Background and Overview
    DoubleTrouble is a simple game.  The extent of the gameplay is to press directional buttons on the keyboard to shift and join together different numes to get to 2048 and beyond.

    I am also designing a computer AI that will implement the optimal strategy to win this game.


## Functionality
    * Users can press direction keys to shift tiles accordingly.
    * If adjacent tiles have the same number and are shifted together, they sum together and combine into a new tile.
    * Each turn, a new tile is randomly generated on the board 
    * Player wins once they have a 2048 tile, but has the option to keep playing to get a high score

## MVP Features
    * Game functions properly
    * Basic visuals and interactive interface
    * Take visuals and add clean styling
    * New tiles are randomly generated
    * Win and Game Over messages

### Bonus Features
    * AI successfully completes the game
    * AI completes the game effectively
